# PeoplePortal

PeoplePortal is an iPhone application that explores the universal desire to be
someone else, and the ways in which social media have inflamed that
desire. It simulates the experience of using Twitter as if
youâ€™re signed in from another account of your choice. Once you
"become" a Twitter account, you are able to view the same home
timeline that they do and receive the same notifications (for follows,
mentions, and retweets) that they do.
