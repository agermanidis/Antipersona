With the advent of social media, the way we perform our identities has
drastically changed. Our identity has become something more
well-defined, and much easier to control. At the same time, we have
grown to feel much closer to other people’s identities through their
social media feeds, casually scrolling through months of social media
activity when we meet a new person. There has never been another time
in history when we lived vicariously through so many other people at
once.

It might be the case that one identity is not enough to express our
individuality anymore. That the idea of cultivating a singular,
specific identity has become outdated. In which case the question
arises: why can’t identities travel across bodies and become a
commons, so that everybody can enjoy each identity's unique privileges?

Antipersona is a radical attempt at redistributing this kind of
“identity wealth.” It is an iPhone app that makes extensive use of the
Twitter API to simulate the experience of using the platform as if
you’re  in from any user account of your choice. When you “shadow” a
person, you get to see the same timeline that they see and receive the
same notifications (for follows, mentions, and retweets) that they
receive throughout the day.

Go ahead, try a new identity today. Get a glimpse of the world of
frictionless identity adoption that awaits us.

for more details on the way the app uses the Twitter API endpoints.
