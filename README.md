# [PeoplePortal](http://peopleportal.co)

PeoplePortal is an iPhone application that explores the universal desire to be
someone else, and the ways in which social media have inflamed that
desire. It simulates the experience of using Twitter as if
youâ€™re signed in from any user account of your choice, allowing you to
live vicariously through them. When you "shadow" an account, you
are able to see the same timeline that they see and receive the
same notifications (for follows, mentions, and retweets) that they
receive.

Live in the future of frictionless identity adoption, today.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for more details on the architecture of the app.
